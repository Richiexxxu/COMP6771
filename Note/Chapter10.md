- Most of the segmentation algorithms in this chapter are based on one of two basic properties of image intensity values: discontinuity and and similarity.
- First approach: partition an image into region based on abrupt changes in in tensity, such as edges.
- Second approaches: partitioning an image into regions that are similar according to a set of predefined criteria.
