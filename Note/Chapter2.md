# 2.5 Some basic relationships between pixels.
 - Several important relationships between pixels in a digital image.
 - When referring in the following discussion to particular pixels, we use lowercase letters, such as $p$ and $q$.


# 2.5.1 Neighbors of A pixels
- a pixel $p$    
- two horizontal and two vetical neighbors: 
    $$(x+1, y), (x-1,y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)$$
  This set of pixels, called the 4-neighbors of $p$, is donated $N_4(p)$.
-  The four diagonal neighbors of $p$ have coordinates:
       $$(x+1,y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x-1, y-1)$$
    This set of pixels are demoted $N_D(p)$.
- The previous eight pixels together, are called 8-neighbors of $p$, denoted by $N_8(p)$. 
- The set of image locations of neighbors of a point $p$ is called the neighborhood of $p$,
