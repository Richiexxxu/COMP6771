## 4.3 Sample and Fourier Transform of Sampled Functions. 

 - A continuous function, $f(t)$, and we wish to somaple at uniform intervals ($\Delta T$) of the independent variable $t$. 
 - We assume that the function extend from $- \infty$ to $- \infty$ with respect to t. One way to model sampling is to multiply $f(t)$ by a sampling function equal to a train of impulses $\Delta T$
